We will use the NASA Acoustics and Vibration Database vibration sensor readings as our dataset for this study. 

In the NASA study, sensor readings were taken on four bearings that were run to failure under constant load over multiple days. 

**Anomaly Detection**

Anomaly detection is the task of determining when something has gone astray from the “norm”.

Anomaly detection using neural networks is modeled in an unsupervised / self-supervised manner; as opposed to supervised learning, where there is a one-to-one correspondence between input feature samples and their corresponding output labels. 

The presumption is that normal behavior, and hence the quantity of available “normal” data, is the norm and that anomalies are the exception to the norm to the point where the modeling of “normalcy” is possible.

The goal is to predict future bearing failures before they happen.
